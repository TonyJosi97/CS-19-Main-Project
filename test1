The project aims at securing confidential data communicated via emails to be secured using a new methodology that combines Compression, Encryption and Pixel Value Differencing. The process of securing the data involves: Arithmetic coding was applied on secret message for lossless compression, which provided 22% higher embedding capacity. The compressed secret message is subjected to AES encryption; this provides higher security in the cases of steganalysis attacks. After compression and encryption, LSB substitution and PVD are applied.
